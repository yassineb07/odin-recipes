	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul class="inglist">
			<li>4 (6 ounce) bone-in chicken thighs, with skin</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
			<li>3 stalks celery, chopped</li>
			<li>½ onion, chopped</li>
			<li>1 (4 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
			<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
			<li>1 (14 ounce) can stewed tomatoes</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons herbes de Provence</li>
			<li>¾ cup water</li>
			<li>3 cubes chicken bouillon, crumbled</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
			<li>1 pinch red pepper flakes (Optional)</li>
			<li>1 pinch ground black pepper to taste (Optional)</li>
		</ul>
	<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol class="stplist">
			<li>Rinse chicken thighs and pat dry with paper towels. Heat oil in the pot of an electric pressure cooker (such as Instant
			Pot®) on "Saute" mode; add chicken. Cook until browned, about 6 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate, reserving
			drippings in the pot.</li>
			<li>Place celery, onion, and mushrooms in the pot; cook and stir until soft, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook until
			fragrant, about 2 minutes. Place chicken back in the pot; add tomatoes and tomato paste. Sprinkle with herbes de
			Provence. Top with water and bouillon.</li>
			<li>IClose and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for
			pressure to build. Cook for 11 minutes.</li>
			<li>TRelease pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes.
			Unlock and remove lid carefully, turning it away from you. Test chicken for doneness; an instant-read thermometer
			inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Season the chicken to taste with red pepper flakes and
			black pepper.</li>
